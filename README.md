# Basic Calculator Project at CODSOFT

## Project Overview

To create a basic calculator using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, you'll need to implement an interactive interface with buttons for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations. The calculator should have a display screen to show user input and results. This project is an excellent way to practice your skills in these technologies, combining front-end design with interactive functionality.

This project emphasizes the following key areas:
- **Interactive Interface**: Design a user-friendly interface with buttons for numerical inputs and basic arithmetic operations.
- **Display Screen**: Implement a screen to display user input and calculation results, ensuring real-time feedback.
- **CSS Grid System**: Use CSS grid to align and organize buttons, creating a clean and accessible layout.
- **JavaScript Functionality**: Utilize event listeners, if-else statements, operators, and loops to handle user input, perform calculations, and update the display.

By working on this project, you'll enhance your understanding of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interact to create dynamic and responsive web applications.
